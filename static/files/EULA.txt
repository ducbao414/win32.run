between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Microsoft Corporation for the Microsoft software
product identified above, which includes computer software and may include associated media, printed
materials, “online” or electronic documentation, and Internet-based services (“Product”). An amendment or
addendum to this EULA may accompany the Product. YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
EULA BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO
NOT INSTALL OR USE THE PRODUCT; YOU MAY RETURN IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A
FULL REFUND.

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you the following rights provided that you comply with all terms and
conditions of this EULA:

Installation and use. You may install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Product on a single computer,
such as a workstation, terminal or other device (“Workstation Computer”). The Product may not be used by
more than two (2) processors at any one time on any single Workstation Computer. You may permit a maximum
of ten (10) computers or other electronic devices (each a “Device”) to connect to the Workstation Computer to
utilize the services of the Product solely for File and Print services, Internet Information Services, and remote
access (including connection sharing and telephony services). The ten connection maximum includes any indirect
connections made through “multiplexing” or other software or hardware which pools or aggregates connections.
Except as otherwise permitted by the NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote Desktop features described
below, you may not use the Product to permit any Device to use, access, display or run other executable software
residing on the Workstation Computer, nor may you permit any Device to use, access, display, or run the Product
or Product’s user interface, unless the Device has a separate license for the Product.
Mandatory Activation. The license rights granted under this EULA are limited to the first thirty (30) days after
you first install the Product unless you supply information required to activate your licensed copy in the
manner described during the setup sequence of the Product. You can activate the Product through the use of
the Internet or telephone; toll charges may apply. You may also need to reactivate the Product if you modify your
computer hardware or alter the Product. There are technological measures in this Product that are designed to
prevent unlicensed or illegal use of the Product. You agree that we may use those measures.
Storage/Network Use. You may also store or install a copy of the Product on a storage device, such as a network
server, used only to install or run the Product on your other Workstation Computers over an internal network;
however, you must acquire and dedicate an additional license for each separate Workstation Computer on or
from which the Product is installed, used, accessed, displayed or run. A license for the Product may not be shared or
used concurrently on different Workstation Computers.
Reservation of Rights. Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA.

2. UPGRADES. To use a Product identified as an upgrade, you must first be licensed for the product identified by
Microsoft as eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no longer use the product that formed the basis
for your upgrade eligibility.
3. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES. This EULA applies to updates, supplements, add-on components, or
Internet-based services components, of the Product that Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you
after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Product, unless we provide other terms along with the update,
supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based services component. Microsoft reserves the right to
discontinue any Internet-based services provided to you or made available to you through the use of the Product.
This EULA does not grant you any rights to use the Windows Media Format Software Development Kit
(“WMFSDK”) components contained in the Product to develop a software application that uses Windows Media
technology. If you wish to use the WMFSDK to develop such an application, visit
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/imedia/windowsmedia/sdk/wmsdk.asp, accept a separate license for the
WMFSDK, download the appropriate WMFSDK, and install it on your system.
4. TRANSFER—Internal. You may move the Product to a different Workstation Computer. After the transfer, you
must completely remove the Product from the former Workstation Computer. Transfer to Third Party. The initial
user of the Product may make a one-time transfer of the Product to another end user. The transfer has to include
all component parts, media, printed materials, this EULA, and if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity. The
transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the
transferred Product must agree to all the EULA terms. No Rental. You may not rent, lease, lend or provide
commercial hosting services to third parties with the Product.

reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Product, except and only to the extent that it is expressly
permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

the terms and conditions of this EULA, in which case you must destroy all copies of the Product and all of its
component parts.
7. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

NetMeeting/Remote Assistance/Remote Desktop Features. The Product contains NetMeeting, Remote
Assistance, and Remote Desktop technologies that enable the Product or other applications installed on the
Workstation Computer to be used remotely between two or more computers, even if the Product or application is
installed on only one Workstation Computer. You may use NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote Desktop
with all Microsoft products; provided however, use of these technologies with certain Microsoft products may
require an additional license. For Microsoft and non-Microsoft products, you should consult the license
agreement accompanying the applicable product or contact the applicable licensor to determine whether use of
NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, or Remote Desktop is permitted without an additional license.
Consent to Use of Data. You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may collect and use technical information
gathered in any manner as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the Product.
Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our products or to provide customized services or
technologies to you. Microsoft may disclose this information to others, but not in a form that personally identifies
you.
Internet Gaming/Update Features. If you choose to utilize the Internet gaming or update features within the
Product, it is necessary to use certain computer system, hardware, and software information to implement the
features. By using these features, you explicitly authorize Microsoft or its designated agent to access and utilize
the necessary information for Internet gaming and/or updating purposes. Microsoft may use this information
solely to improve our products or to provide customized services or technologies to you. Microsoft may disclose
this information to others, but not in a form that personally identifies you.
Internet-Based Services Components. The Product contains components that enable and facilitate the use of
certain Internet-based services. You acknowledge and agree that Microsoft may automatically check the version
of the Product and/or its components that you are utilizing and may provide upgrades or fixes to the Product
that will be automatically downloaded to your Workstation Computer.
Security Updates. Content providers are using the digital rights management technology (“Microsoft DRM”)
contained in this Product to protect the integrity of their content (“Secure Content”) so that their intellectual
property, including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. Owners of such Secure Content (“Secure
Content Owners”) may, from time to time, request Microsoft to provide security related updates to the Microsoft
DRM components of the Product (“Security Updates”) that may affect your ability to copy, display and/or play
Secure Content through Microsoft software or third party applications that utilize Microsoft DRM. You therefore
agree that, if you elect to download a license from the Internet which enables your use of Secure Content,
Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download onto your computer such Security Updates
that a Secure Content Owner has requested that Microsoft distribute. Microsoft will not retrieve any personally
identifiable information, or any other information, from your computer by downloading such Security Updates.

8. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. Product identified as “Not for Resale” or “NFR,” may not be resold,

11. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR PRODUCT ACQUIRED IN THE US AND CANADA.
Microsoft warrants that the Product will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying
materials for a period of ninety days from the date of receipt.
If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial
law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO
DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY
DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE NINETY (90) DAY PERIOD, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations
on how long an implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
Any supplements or updates to the Product, including without limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot
fixes provided to you after the expiration of the ninety day Limited Warranty period are not covered by
any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.
LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your exclusive
remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below. Except for any refund elected by
Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Product does not meet Microsoft’s Limited Warranty, and, to the
maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. The terms
of Section 13 below (“Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages”) are also
incorporated into this Limited Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This
Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others which vary from state/jurisdiction
to state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Microsoft’s and its suppliers’ entire liability and your
exclusive remedy shall be, at Microsoft’s option from time to time exercised subject to applicable law,
(a) return of the price paid (if any) for the Product, or (b) repair or replacement of the Product, that does not
meet this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a copy of your receipt. You will receive
the remedy elected by Microsoft without charge, except that you are responsible for any expenses you may
incur (e.g. cost of shipping the Product to Microsoft). This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Product
has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. Any replacement Product will
be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.
Outside the United States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by
Microsoft are available without proof of purchase from an authorized international source. To exercise
your remedy, contact: Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond,
WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country.
